# Technical Note
## Monetary Policy Risk Dashboard – Mexico

### Objective
This technical note documents the analytical approach, data sources,
and assumptions used to construct the monetary policy risk dashboard
for Mexico.

### Data Sources
- Inflation data (headline and core): INEGI
- Policy rate: Banco de México
- Macroeconomic indicators: public statistical sources

### Methodology
The analysis focuses on:
- Evolution of headline vs. core inflation
- Monetary policy stance and real interest rates
- Risk signals derived from inflation persistence and policy tightness

Visualizations are designed to support exploratory analysis rather than
causal inference.

### Limitations
- The analysis is descriptive and does not estimate causal effects.
- Results depend on publicly available macroeconomic data and revisions.

### Use Case
This project is intended as a portfolio example of applied economic
analysis and data visualization using Python and public data.
